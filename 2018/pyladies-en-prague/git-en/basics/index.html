    <h1>Git</h1>
<p>Whether you code or write documents, often you end up
with multiple versions of the same file.
You may want to archive one set of changes that are not needed at the moment,
then send another set of changes to your colleagues for a review.
At a certain point, keeping track of all these versions becomes unfeasible.</p>
<p>Tools like Dropbox or Google Drive, which you may know already, can help a bit.
These tools allow you to share your files easily, or to restore their content
to an earlier point in time.
Here's an example:</p>
<p><span class="figure"><a href="/2018/pyladies-en-prague/git-en/basics/static/dropbox.png"><img src="/2018/pyladies-en-prague/git-en/basics/static/dropbox.png" alt="Versioning interface in Dropbox"></a></span></p>
<p>Unfortunatelly, you can only see different versions of a <em>single file</em>.
Also, it's hard to tell which version you might want to restore since
there is no indication of how individual versions differ.
A relatively large project wouldn't be manageable with this approach.</p>
<p>Therefore, programmers tend to use more powerful tools
dubbed <em>version control system</em> (VCS).
Currently, the most popular one is Git, and we'll learn more about it in this lesson.</p>
<div class="admonition note"><p>We will rely on the command line.
If you are not confident working with it yet, look at the
<a href="/2018/pyladies-en-prague/beginners-en/cmdline/">introduction</a>.</p>
<p>Remember: don't write the <code>$</code> at the start.
It is shown here to indicate the beginning of each command.</p>
</div><h2>Installation</h2>
<p>The process of installing Git is described 
<a href="/2018/pyladies-en-prague/git/install/">here</a>.
If you have skipped the lesson before, you might want to get back to it now.</p>
<h2>Repository</h2>
<p>Each project that you want to version-control needs to be stored in its own directory.
Create a new directory now and navigate inside (use the command <code>cd</code>).
Then, create a new Git <em>repository</em> using the command <code>git init</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code><span style="color: #00aaaa">$</span> git init
Initialized empty Git repository in ./.git/</code></pre></div><p>At first glance, it looks like nothing happened.
This command created a <em>hidden</em> directory with the name <code>.git</code> and stored some information in there.
You can see the file using <code>ls -a</code> (Linux) or <code>dir /a</code> (Windows).
<code>.git</code> is a hidden directory because it is managed only by Git
and you shouldn't be changing anything inside.</p>
<p>The repository is empty for now.
You can see for yourself by invoking <code>git status</code>, a command that shows information
about the state of the repository:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code><span style="color: #00aaaa">$</span> git status
On branch master

Initial commit

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)</code></pre></div><p><em>“On branch master”</em> refers to so-called branches, we'll get back to that later.
<em>“Initial commit”</em> means that there is no revision stored yet.
And <em>“nothing to commit”</em> says that there are no files to be saved and versioned in the directory.</p>
<h2>First revision</h2>
<p>Try adding something to Git now!</p>
<p>Create a new file <code>poem.txt</code> and write a short poem inside.
It should span at least five lines so that we have enough to work with.
Then, try executing <code>git status</code> again: Git reports that there is a new
file in the directory and that it isn't managed by Git yet.</p>
<!-- XXX: Color coding! -->

<div class="highlight"><pre><code><span style="color: #00aaaa">$</span> git status
On branch master

Initial commit

Untracked files:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)

        <span style="color: #aa0000">poem.txt</span>

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)</code></pre></div><p>We need to make Git track each new file explicitely.
Let's do that for the file with your poem:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code><span style="color: #00aaaa">$</span> git add poem.txt</code></pre></div><p>Then check the state of the repository again:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code><span style="color: #00aaaa">$</span> git status
On branch master

Initial commit

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

        <span style="color: #00aa00">new file:   poem.txt</span></code></pre></div><p>The lines in green (“changes to be committed”)
will be included in the next batch of changes (a <em>commit</em>) that you will create.
Let's create our first commit:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code><span style="color: #00aaaa">$</span> git commit
[master (root-commit) 1a009f4] First revision
 1 file changed, 6 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 poem.txt</code></pre></div><p>After entering this command, an editor opens where you can write a short description 
of this commit, briefly summarizing what changes have been made.
This is referred to as a <em>commit message</em>. For now, a simple <code>First revision</code> will do.
You can ignore the existing lines starting with <code>#</code>, these are just for your information.
Git will ignore them as well. Finally, save the file and close the editor.</p>
<div class="admonition note"><p class="admonition-title">Working with editors</p>
<p>In Windows, if you have
<a href="/2018/pyladies-en-prague/git/install/">set up your Git correctly</a>,
Notepad will be used as the editor; simply write something, save (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd>)
and close (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F4</kbd>).</p>
<p>In Linux or macOS, an editor called Nano appears directly in the command line window.
You can recognize it by the keyboard shortcut help on the bottom two lines.
Write something, save using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd>,
confirm the name of the file (<kbd>Enter</kbd>)
and exit the editor using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd>.</p>
<p>If you haven't set up Git accordingly, Vim is invoked directly in the command line window
and will be used as the default editor.
It is a relatively complicated editor and learning to use it is beyond the scope
of this lesson. You can recognize it by one or two lines at the bottom that show a path
to a temporary file that you are currently editing.
In that case, first press
<kbd>Esc</kbd>, then type <code>:q!</code> (colon, lower letter Q, exclamation mark)
and confirm by pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
Then set up Git corrently and try <code>git commit</code> again.</p>
</div><p>Try reporting on the repository again:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code><span style="color: #00aaaa">$</span> git status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean</code></pre></div><p>This short report means that nothing has changed since the last commit.
That is expected since we've just commited all our changes!</p>
<p>Now let's have a look at what has changed in the last commit.
Execute <code>git show</code>:</p>

in formulating the commit messages.
There are common conventions that most programmers follow:
the first line summarizes the changes, the second line is left blank,
and the following lines list the reasons for the change or describe
the changes themselves in more detail.
Each line should have under 70 characters in length;
the lenth of the comments (lines starting with <code>#</code>) can serve as a guide here.
It is not worth going into detail for changes that are trivial or obvious;
rather, focus on the broader context and reasons for the changes.
Anything that can help whomever will try to understand the changes in the commit;
this might include you few months later.</p>
<p>My commit message will be the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code>Split long lines

just 70 characters, you might be taking too many steps at once.

might be better to commit as two separate revisions.</p>

    First revision</code></pre></div><p><code>git log</code> prints all commits starting from the newest one and going
all the way back to the initial commit at the origin of the repository.</p>
<p>When there are so many commits that they don't fit on a single screen
of your command line window, you can browse back and forth using
<kbd>PgUp</kbd>/<kbd>PgDn</kbd>.
Finally, exit by pressing <kbd>q</kbd>.</p>
<div class="admonition note"><p>There are many options that customize the output of <code>git log</code>.
They are all described (at great length)
in the built-in documentation (command <code>git help log</code>).
If the help is displayed in the command line window, press <kbd>q</kbd>
to exit.</p>
<p>My personal favorite combination is <code>git log --oneline --graph --decorate --cherry-mark --boundary</code>.</p>
</div><p>To see all details about any commit,
execute <code>git show 5ff0b</code>, replacing <code>5ff0b</code>
with the first few characters of the <span class="yellow">Git commit ID</span>.</p>
<h2>gitk</h2>
<p>The command line can convey all sorts of information,
but not always in a clear way.
A graphical application called <em>gitk</em> offers a more intuitive look
at the history of your repository;
you can start it using the command <code>gitk --all</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>gitk --all
</pre></div><p><span class="figure"><a href="/2018/pyladies-en-prague/git-en/basics/static/gitk.png"><img src="/2018/pyladies-en-prague/git-en/basics/static/gitk.png" alt="Graphical application Gitk"></a></span></p>
<p>The application doesn't look very appealing (almost as if
it has been designed by programmers who emphasise substance over form),
but it will suit our needs.
Get familiar with it first, then close it, commit a few more sets of changes
and finally explore them using <code>git log</code> and <code>gitk --all</code>.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>These are the Git basics that we'll need in the following lessons.
Whenever you perform <code>git add <var>file</var></code> and <code>git commit</code>,
the current version of the file is saved and will be accessible even if you delete the file later.
You can always view any past version of any file in your repository,
and review all changes made since the last time the project was saved.</p>
<p>Maybe all this sounded unnecessarily too complicated for a beginner.
Indeed, our projects will be relatively simple and easy to manage
even without the use of Git.
But it's a good idea to learn using it from the very beginning;
when you get to participate in bigger projects, already being used to Git
will come very handy.</p>
<p>So, from now on, whenever you make even a small but meaningful change to your program,
as long as the program works at least as well as it did before,
use <code>git add</code> and <code>git commit</code> to save the change in Git.</p>
