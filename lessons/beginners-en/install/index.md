# Python installation

We will do two things in this section:

* We will install Python and Conda with virtual environments
* We will create virtual environment

You might ask why we all need this.

Python is programming language (way how to tell computers what to do)
and also program we need so we can talk to our computer in Python language.

Virtual environment is something that will take care of that all computers
will behave very similar.
After we will activate it we won't need special materials for Linux,
Windows and Macs.


> [note]
> We will use in the future another advantage of virtual environments: 
> every venv is separated from each other so if we will install some
> module (extension for Python) we will have it in just that environment
> where we want to have it. If that library would broke something in your 
> project another projects will be safe. 

Choose page regarding your operation system:

* [Linux]({{ subpage_url('linux') }})
* [Windows]({{ subpage_url('windows') }})
* [macOS]({{ subpage_url('macos') }})


If you have other system or if you have some other problem, don't worry
to ask coach (raise red postit paper) or send e-mail.
