# Comparison

Do you still remember what an <em>operator</em> is?

In our homework, we learned some basic arithmetic operators.
When we add one more (`//`) they will look like that:

<table class="table">
    <tr>
        <th>Symbol</th>
        <th>Example</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code></td>
        <td><code>1 + 1</code></td>
        <td>Basic arithmetic</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>-</code></td>
        <td><code>-5</code></td>
        <td>Negation</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>//</code>; <code>%</code></td>
        <td><code>7 // 2</code>; <code>7 % 2</code></td>
        <td>Integer division, Remainderk</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>**</code></td>
        <td><code>3 ** 2</code></td>
        <td>Power (3 to the power of 2)</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Python has other types of operators. *Comparison* (relational) 
operators are used to compare values.
Try what they are doing!
(You can do it by `print` in your code
or you can try `python`'s command line.)

<table class="table">
    <tr>
        <th>Symbol</th>
        <th>Example</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>==</code>, <code>!=</code></td>
        <td><code>1 == 1</code>, <code>1 != 1</code></td>
        <td>equal, not equal</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code></td>
        <td><code>3 &lt; 5</code>, <code>3 &gt; 5</code></td>
        <td>greater than, less than</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;=</code></td>
        <td><code>3 &lt;= 5</code>, <code>3 &gt;= 5</code></td>
        <td>Greater or equal, less or equal</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Comparison values are so called *boolean*
(after [G. Boolea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole)).
They are used everytime we want to know if somethong is `True` or `False`.
Boolean types are exactly those two - `True` and `False`.

Like all values `True` and `False` can be assigned to variables:


```python
true = 1 < 3 #we have to type it in lowercase now cause True is reserved word in Python
print(true)

false = 1 == 3
print(false)
```

> [note]
> Notice that you have to find equality by two equal signs: `3 == 3`
> One equal assigns value to the variable and two equals
> are comparing values (of variables).

<code>True</code> and <code>False</code> 
can be used directly in a program.
Just keep an eye on capitalization.

```python
print(True)
print(False)
```

## Conditions

{% if var('pyladies') -%}
{% set rootname = 'pyladies' %}
{%- else -%}
{% set rootname = 'naucse-python' %}
{%- endif %}

Now write into new file (e. g. `if.py`) this:

```python
side = float(input('Enter the side of a square in centimeters: '))
print("The Perimeter of a square with a side of", side,"cm is", side * 4,"cm")
print("The Area of a square with a side of", side,"cm is", side * side, "cm2")
```

what happens when you enter a negative number? Does the output make sense?

As we can see computer is doing exactly what it is told and doesn't
think about context. So you have to do that for it.
It would be nice if the program tells the user whom enter
negative number that they entered nonsense,
How to do it?

Letâ€™s try to set a variable that will be `True` when a user enters a positive number.


{% filter solution %}
    That variable could be set like that:

    ```python
    side = float(input('Enter the side of a square in centimeters: '))
    positive_number = side > 0
    ```
{% endfilter %}

And then we will tell the program to use this variable. 
For that purpose we will use the `if` and `else` statements.


```python
side = float(input('Enter the side of a square in centimeters: '))
positive_number = side > 0


if positive_number:
    print("The Perimeter of a square with a side of", side,"cm is", side * 4,"cm")
    print("The Area of a square with a side of", side,"cm is", side * side, "cm2")
else:
    print("The side must be a positive number!")

print("Thank you for using the geometric calculator.")

```

So after `if` there is *condition* which is the
expression we'll use for decision making.
After the condition there has to be colon (`:`).
Then follow the commands to be executed if condition is true.
There has to be indentation 4 spaces after every colon we will use
in Python.
Then on the same level as `if` is we will write `else:` with colon in the end and next line
line with commands that will be executed if condition is false and also indented.<br>
Then you can write other code, not intended, that will be executed every time because
the if statement already ended.

> 2 or even 11 and you can also use tabulator. The point is that

## Other conditional statements

Sometimes the `else` statement is not necessary.
The following program does nothing extra if the number is not equal to zero.

```python
number = int(input('Enter a number, to which I will add 3: '))
if number == 0:
    print('This is easy!')
print(number, '+ 3 =', number + 3)
```

Sometimes several conditions are needed, for which we have the `elif` statement
(combimation of `else` and `if`).
It's between `if` and `else`.
Command `elif` may be present more times after one `if` but there
will be run only one (to be precisely the first true one) "branch" 
where the conditions are met. 


```python
age = int(input('How old are you? '))
if age >= 150:
    print('And from which planet are you?')
elif age >= 18:
    # This branch will not be executed for "200", for example.
    print('We can offer: wine, cider, or vodka.')
elif age >= 1:
    print('We can offer: milk, tea or water')
elif age >= 0:
    print('Unfortunately, we are out of Sunar.')
else :
    # If no condition is met from above - age had to be a negative
    print('Visitors from the future are not welcomed here!')

```

## Rock paper scissors

`If`s can be nested - after `if` and indentation there can be other `if`.


```python
pc_choise = 'rock'
user_choise = input('rock, paper, or scissors?')

if user_choise == 'rock':
    if pc_choise == 'rock':
        print('Draw.')
    elif pc_choise == 'scissors':
        print ('You win!')
    elif pc_choise == 'paper':
        print ('Computer won!')
elif user_choise == 'scissors':
    if pc_choise == 'rock':
        print('Computer won!')
    elif pc_choise == 'scissors':
        print('Draw.')
    elif pc_choise == 'paper':
        print('You win!')
elif user_choise == 'paper':
    if pc_choise == 'rock':
        print('You win!')
    elif pc_choise == 'scissors':
        print('Computer won!')
    elif pc_choise == 'paper':
        print('Draw.')
else:
    print('I do not understand.')

```

Yay, your first game!<br>
Now we will need to overwrite the pc_choice so it would act 
randomly. We will talk about how to do it next time.
